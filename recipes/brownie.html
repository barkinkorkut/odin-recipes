        <h2 id="b">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Chocolate chips</li>
            <li>2 eggs + water </li>
            <li>Powdered sugar</li>
            <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
            <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
            <li>Finally, bake! Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
